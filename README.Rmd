### Update to NEW version 1.0.0 soon on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).



### Why `container`?
`container` extends base R `list` functionality with the goal to
serve as an **easy** and **safe** to use `list` alternative. It is based on 
`list` but provides

* compact printing
* feature rich add and extract operations (no unintended `NULL` or `NA`)
* safe replace and removal operations (no unintended override or delete)
* optional reference semantics
* and some more ...

to make life easier when writing **critical** R code and managing 
**large** lists.

Based on the *Container* class, this package also comes with specialized data
structures *Deque*, *Set* and *Dict* and a *special* class
`dict.table`, which is designed to extend
[data.table](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) by a rich set of
functions to manage data columns.


### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
```


### Usage

The `container` package was originally created to enhance code development
but since version 1.0.0 also gained some functionality that can be useful
in an interactive R session, where you most likely use a `container` the same
way you would use a base R `list`, plus some new operations. For example,

```{r}
library(container)
co <- container(x = cars[, 1], y = cars[, 2], data = cars)
co
```

some standard operations ...
```{r}
co[1:2]
```
```{r}
co[["x"]][1:10]
```

some new operations ...
```{r}
# Use any number of (mixed) indices
co[1:2, "data"]
```
```{r}
# Replace element by value
co[[{cars}]] <- iris
co
```
```{r}
co2 = container(x = 111, data = NULL, -111)
co2
```
```{r}
# Merge-update with other containers
co = update(co, co2)
co
```
```{r}
# Easier rename
rename(co, "x", "A")
```
