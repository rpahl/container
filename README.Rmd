# container <img src="images/logo.png" align="right" width="163" height="104"/>

[container] extends the functionality of base R [list] and the [data.table]
package and with [deque], [set], and [dict] provides common data structures
not provided by base R, (resembling Python's dict type).
In addition, it provides [iterators] and supports both reference and copy
semantics.

## Why `container`?


## Features


## Installation

You can install the released version of container from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
```

```{r load-container, include = FALSE}
#library(container)
```

### container vs list
The [container] can be seen as a base R [list] with extended functionality.
There is basically nothing that you can do with a [list] that
can't can also be done with the [container], but the [container] is
capable of much more. Below you find some (of many) extra things the
[container] is capable of.

```{r container-vs-list}
library(container)

co <- container(1:10, l = list("a", 1))
li <- as.list(co)
```

While the [list] output can be very long and hard to read
```{r}
li
```

the elements of a [container] object are printed in a very compact and
readable way.
```{r}
co
```


The [container] allows to find and replace elements directly without the need
to determine their index first, by passing them in curly brackets. First, let's
see how to do it with the list.
```{r}
index = which(sapply(li, identical, 1:10))
li[[index]] <- 1:3
li
```

```{r}
co[[{1:10}]] <- 1:3
co
```

```{r}
unpack(co)
```

### dict.table vs data.frame
The [dict.table] can be seen as a base R [data.frame] with
extended functionality.
There is basically nothing that you can do with a [data.frame] that
can't can also be done with the [dict.table], but the [dict.table] is
capable of much more. Below you find some (of many) extra things the
[dict.table] is capable of.

```{r dict.table-vs-data.frame}
dit = dict.table(a = 1:2, b = 3:4)
dit
```
