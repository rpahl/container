# container <img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="logo" align="right" width="163" height="104"/>

The {container} package offers an enhanced version of base R's `list` with a
carefully designed set of extract, replace, and remove operations that make
it easier and safer to work with list-like data structures.

### Why use {container}?

{container} objects work similar to base R lists and on top provide

* safe and flexible operations to
  * extract (custom default values, no unintended `NULL`)
  * add and replace (mixed indices, no unintended overrides)
  * remove (loose or strict deletion, remove by index or value)
* compact printing
* optional reference semantics

In addition, {container} provides specialized data structures
[Deque, Set, and Dict]( articles/deque-set-dict.html)
and a *special* class `dict.table`, designed to extend
[data.table](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) by
container operations to safely
[Manage data columns with dict.table](articles/manage-data-columns.html).


### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
```


### Usage

```{r}
library(container)
co <- container(colors = c("Red", "Green"), numbers = c(1, 2, 3), data = cars)

co
```

Use like a base R list

```{r}
co[["colors"]] <- c("Blue", "Yellow")

co[["colors"]]

co[2:1]
```

Safe extract

```{r, error = TRUE}
at(co, "colours")   # oops

at(co, "colors")
```

Safe remove

```{r, error = TRUE}
co <- delete_at(co, "colours")   # oops

co <- delete_at(co, "colors")
co
```

Flexible peek

```{r, error = TRUE}
at(co, "colors")   # oops

peek_at(co, "colors")

peek_at(co, "colors", .default = c("black", "white"))
```

Safe replace

```{r, error = TRUE}
co <- replace_at(co, num = 1:10)   # oops

co <- replace_at(co, numbers = 1:10)
co
```

* [Manage data columns with dict.table](articles/manage-data-columns.html)


### When *not* to use {container}

Don't bother using the {container} framework when *speed* is of high importance.
An exception is the `dict.table` class, which is very fast as it is based on
[data.table](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table).
Other than that, if computation speed is critical for your application,
we refer you to using base R lists or packages that were optimized for
performance, such as the
[collections](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=collections) or
[cppcontainers](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cppcontainers) package.
