# container <img src="images/logo.png" align="right" width="163" height="104"/>

container provides common container data structures deque, set, dict (resembling
Python's dict type) and dict.table (combining dict and data.table) with
typical member functions to insert, delete and access container elements.
Furthermore, provides iterators and supports both reference and copy semantics.

## Installation

You can install the released version of container from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
```


## container vs list
The `container` can be seen as a basic R `list` with extended functionality.
There is basically nothing that you can do with a `list` that can't can be
done with the `container`, but the `container` is capable of much more.
Below you find some (of many) extra things the `container` is capable of.

```{r container-vs-list}
library(container)

co <- container(1:10, b = NA, l = list("a", 1))
li <- as.list(co)
```
Since they are similar, you can always transform back-and-forth between both
types using respectively `as.list` or `as.container`.

The `container` object by default prints more compact than the `list`.
```{r}
co

li
```

```{r}
str(co) # TODO
```

The `container` allows to find and replace elements directly without the need
to determine their index first, by passing them in curly brackets.
```{r}
index = which(sapply(li, identical, 1:10))
li[[index]] <- 1:5
li

#co[[{1:10}]] <- 1:5 # TODO
#co[[{list("a", 1)}]] <- 1:5 # TODO
#co[c(T, F, T)] # TODO
co
```

```{r}
unpack(co)
```

## dict.table vs data.frame
The `dict.table` can be seen as a basic R `data.frame` with extended functionality.
There is basically nothing that you can do with a `data.frame` that can't can be
done with the `dict.table`, but the `dict.table` is capable of much more.
Here are some examples for why you might want to prefer the `dict.table`.


```{r dict.table-vs-data.frame}
co = container(1, b = NA, 1:3, c = container("a", 1))
co
```
