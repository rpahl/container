## Update
Update to version 1.0.0 is coming soon to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Intro

This package extends the functionality of base R [list] and the [data.table]
package and with [deque], [set], and [dict] provides additional common data
structures. It furthermore implements [iterators] and supports both reference
and copy semantics.

## Why `container`?


## Features


## Installation

You can install the released version of container from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
```

```{r load-container, include = FALSE}
library(container)
```

### container vs list
Basically all you can do with a [list] can also be done with a [container],
but the [container] is capable of much more.

```{r container-vs-list}
library(container)

co <- container(1:10, l = list("a", 1))
li <- as.list(co)
```

While the [list] output can be very long and hard to read
```{r}
li
```

the elements of a [container] object are printed very compact.
```{r}
co
```


Find and replace of [list] elements requires to determine the index first.
```{r}
element = list("a", 1)
index = which(sapply(li, identical, list("a", 1)))
li[[index]] <- 1:3
li
```

With [container] just pass the element directly in `{}`
```{r}
co[[{element}]] <- 1:3
co
```

Update parameter lists with ease.
```{r}
param = cont(x = 1, foo = "bar") # cont is a shortcut for container
param
```

```{r}
new_param = cont(z = 2, foo = "my foo")
update(param, new_param)
```


### dict.table vs data.frame
Basically all you can do with a [data.table] can also be done with a
[dict.table], but the [dict.table] also provides [dict] functionality.

```{r dict.table-vs-data.frame}
dit = dict.table(a = 1:2, b = 3:4)
dit
```
