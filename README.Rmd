### Update to NEW version 1.0.0 soon on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

*container* extends base R *list* functionality with the goal to
serve as an *easy and safe* to use *list* alternative,
applicable not only for interactive R sessions but specifically to make
life easier in *serious code* development.

In addition, this package provides specialized data structures *deque*,
*set*, *dict*, and *dict.table*, the latter to extend the
[data.table](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) package.

### Why `container` over list?
A `container` is based on `list` but with

* compact printing
* feature rich add, extract, replace, or removal operations
* safer data operations (no more unintended `NULL` or `NA`)
* optional reference semantics
* some more ...

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
```

```{r pre-load, include = FALSE}
library(container, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

### Usage

Use `container` the same way you would use a base R `list`, but enjoy
additional functionalities.

```{r}
library(container)
co <- container(x = c(1.0, 2.0), y = 1:2, data = cars)
co
```

Some standard operations ...
```{r}
co[1:2]
```
```{r}
co[["n"]]
```

Some new operations ...
```{r}
co[1:2, "data", "n"]
```
```{r}
co[[{cars}]] <- iris
co
```
```{r}
co2 = container(x = 1:10, data = NULL, -111)
co = update(co, co2)
co
```
```{r}
rename(co, "x", "X")
```
