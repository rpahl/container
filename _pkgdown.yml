        The dict resembles Python's dict type but here is more flexible by
        providing both associative key-value pair as well as positional array
        semantics.
    contents:
    - dict


  - title: "dict.table"
    desc: >
        The dict.table is a mix of a dict and a data.table and hence derives
        all methods from both.
