Description: Common container data structures deque, set, dict (resembling
    Python's dict type) and dict.table (combining dict and data.table) with
    typical member functions to insert, delete and access container elements.
    Furthermore, iterators are provided and for any created object both
    reference and copy semantics are supported simultaneously.
