### Update to NEW version 1.0.0 soon on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

*container* extends base R *list* functionality with the goal to serve
as an *easy and safe* to use *list* alternative, applicable not only for
interactive R sessions but specifically to make life easier in *serious
code* development.

In addition, this package provides specialized data structures *deque*,
*set*, *dict*, and *dict.table*, the latter to extend the
[data.table](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) package.

### Why `container` over list?

A `container` is based on `list` but with

-   compact printing
-   feature rich add, extract, replace, or removal operations
-   safer data operations (no more unintended `NULL` or `NA`)
-   optional reference semantics
-   some more â€¦

### Installation

``` r
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("container")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/container")
